SRP 
Single Responsibility Principle:

Every Role should have single responsibility.

For example:

A Developer's responsbilities are:
1. Write code
2. Write Unit test 

A Developer should not be responsible for creating a design or testing a software. Since a developer responsibilities is to write code and unit test.
A developer should have one relavent responbility. He/She should not have a multiple responsibility which are not relevent to him/her

Voilation:
If a developer is asked to test an application or is asked to desing an application. Since Testing and architecturing a software is not a developer's responsibility.
