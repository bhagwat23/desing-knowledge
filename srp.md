SRP

Every Role should have single responsibility.

For example:

A Developer's responsbilities are:
1. Write code
2. Write Unit test 

A Developer should not be responsible for creating a design or testing a software. Since a developer responsibilities is to write code and unit test.


Voilation:
If a developer is asked to test an application or is asked to desing an application.
